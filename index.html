      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Bachelor of Science degree from University of Arizona in Environmental
        Science which piqued my interest and passion in GIScience and systems
        for solving real-world problems. Strong education/science professional
        with a Master of Arts in Teaching focused in Science Education -
        Concentration in Chemistry from University of South Florida. Received
        the National Science Foundation Robert Noyce Scholarship that aims to
        recruit talented STEM students and professionals to share their passion
        and expertise in K-12 as science instructors. Experienced Science
        Teacher/professional skilled in Optics/Physics of Refraction, Chemistry,
        Environmental Science, Physical Science, Earth Science, GIS, Teaching
        AP, Lesson Planning, Curriculum Design, and Life Sciences. In my free
        time, I am learning the languages of python, html, css, and javascript,
        playing video games (currently going through Mass Effect 1-3), watching
        re-runs of Star Trek TOS, and getting outside as much as possible,
        though this Arizona transplant is still getting used to the ‚Äúcolorful,
        lawless swamp‚Äù* that is Florida. *Kudos if you got The Office quote!
