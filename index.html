        I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree from University of Arizona in Environmental Science which piqued my interest and passion in GIScience and systems for solving real-world problems. I am a strong education/science professional with a Master of Arts in Teaching focused in Science Education - Concentration in Chemistry from University of South Florida. I received the National Science Foundation Robert Noyce Scholarship that aims to recruit talented STEM students and professionals to share their passion and expertise in K-12 as science instructors. Further, I am an experienced Science Teacher/professional skilled in Optics/Physics of Refraction, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Physical Science, Earth Science, GIS, Teaching AP, Lesson Planning, Curriculum Design, and Life Sciences. In my free time, I am learning the languages of python, html, css, and javascript, playing video games (currently going through Mass Effect 1-3), watching re-runs of Star Trek TOS, and getting outside as much as possible, though this Arizona transplant is still getting used to the “colorful, lawless swamp”* that is Florida.
